# üî∂ Odin Knowledge Graph

Odin is an in-memory, browser-first
[knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph).

> **Note:** Odin is currently in development. It is not yet ready for production
> use. We welcome you to try it out and provide feedback. If you encounter a
> bug, please
> [open an issue](https://github.com/WeCanDoBetter/delphi/issues/new) and help
> us improve the framework!

## üé® Features

- **Browser-first:** Odin is designed to run in the browser. It is written in
  TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. It can be used in any JavaScript
  environment, but it is optimized for the browser.
- **In-memory:** Odin is an in-memory knowledge graph. It does not persist data
  to disk. You can import or export data to and from Odin, but it is not
  designed to be a persistent database.
- **Odin Query Language:** Odin has **its own query language**, called the
  [Odin Query Language (OQL)](https://github.com/WeCanDoBetter/oql). OQL is a
  declarative query language that is similar to SQL. It is designed to be easy
  to learn and use.
